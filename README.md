Login page is done with react and tailwind csss
Milestone 2

The frontend directory will house your React application while the backend directory contains the Node.js server and APIs. This helps in better management and avoids confusion.

To start a React application, you usually depend on create-react-app or other scaffolding tools.

Open your terminal and go to the frontend directory.
Run this:
lua
Copy
npx create-react-app .
That will create all of the boilerplate to complete your React application.
After this setup, you can begin to develop your e-commerce UI components such as product listings, shopping cart, and so on.

Node.js Backend Setup
Initialize your Node.js server with Express or any other preferred framework you want in the backend folder.

5. Login Page Development
The login page will be one of the first user interfaces to be developed in an e-commerce application, so spend efforts putting in a clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS and React.
Components that may need to be built:
Username and Password fields
Login button
Error messages/validation (for example: wrong username/password)
